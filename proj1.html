     <center><b>How swarm drones work</b></center>
     
<p><b>•A swarming system consists of a group of UAVs which cooperate with each other using advanced autonomy, computing, communication and AI protocols to execute various mission objectives with minimal human intervention.</b></p>
<p><b>•The UAVs exhibit self-organising behaviour, collision avoidance between the UAVs and obstacle avoidance with terrain.</b></p>
<p><b>•In a true swarm, there is no true leader and follower, with all members in a swarm having their own ‘mind’ to undertake collective decision-making, adaptive formation flying, and self-healing within the swarm, as Sameer Joshi, the founder of NewSpace, had written for ThePrint earlier.</b></p>
<p><b>•The benefit of such a swarm is that if one drone drops out or a few crash due to enemy counter measures, the group can rearrange or self-heal itself to continue undertaking the mission till the last UAV in air.</b></p>
